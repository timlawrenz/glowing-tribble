### PoC Roadmap: The DINO-Guided Face Generator

*   **Milestone 1: DINOv2 Feature Pyramid Pre-computation**
    *   **Objective:** To create the "ground truth" dataset that the generator will be trained on. This is the most critical preparatory step.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A script is developed that successfully processes a subset of the FFHQ/CelebA-HQ dataset (5k-10k images).
        *   For each image, the script extracts DINOv2 patch embeddings at multiple resolutions (e.g., 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, up to 256x256).
        *   These multi-scale feature pyramids are serialized and stored efficiently, ready for training.
    *   **Outcome:** A complete, pre-computed dataset of DINOv2 feature pyramids. This validates our ability to extract and structure the guidance data.

*   **Milestone 2: Foundational Model Training (Low-Resolution Synthesis)**
    *   **Objective:** To train the initial blocks of the progressive generator and prove that it can learn to synthesize coherent low-resolution images based on DINO features alone.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The first few stages of the generator (e.g., up to 16x16 or 32x32) are implemented.
        *   The model is trained using the pre-computed DINO features as the loss target.
        *   The training loss steadily decreases, demonstrating that the model is learning.
        *   Visual inspection of the low-resolution outputs shows coherent "blobs" that correctly correspond to the general structure of a face (e.g., eye sockets, nose bridge).
    *   **Outcome:** A partially trained generator capable of producing structured, low-resolution face-like images. This validates the core hypothesis that DINO embeddings can replace a traditional GAN discriminator for guidance.

*   **Milestone 3: Full-Resolution Generation and Visual Coherence**
    *   **Objective:** To scale the generator to the full 256x256 resolution and verify that it can produce visually coherent, recognizable human faces.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The progressive generator is fully implemented with all upscaling blocks to 256x256.
        *   The model is trained to produce full-resolution images that are visually inspected for quality.
        *   Generated images consistently show plausible human faces with correct anatomical features (two eyes, nose, mouth, etc.).
        *   Latent space interpolation between two random points produces a smooth, continuous transition between faces, proving the model has learned a meaningful representation.
    *   **Outcome:** A trained generator that produces 256x256 pixel images of human faces, validating the viability of the progressive, DINO-guided approach for creating detailed images.

*   **Milestone 4: Initial Text-Conditioning with CLIP**
    *   **Objective:** To implement basic text-based control over the generated images, proving the model's architecture can be conditioned.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A pre-trained CLIP text encoder is integrated into the model.
        *   The generator is conditioned on text prompts by injecting CLIP embeddings into the initial latent vector.
        *   The model can generate noticeably different outputs based on simple, high-level prompts (e.g., "a man's face," "a woman's face," "face with glasses").
        *   The generated images still maintain the high structural quality enforced by the DINO guidance.
    *   **Outcome:** A rudimentary text-to-image generator that demonstrates the model's controllability, setting the stage for more advanced conditioning techniques like cross-attention.
